# Web Visualization Dashboard

Use HTML and CSS to create a dashboard website. In building this dashboard, there are individual pages for each plot and means to navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. It also have a landing page, comparison of all of the plots, and another page where view the data used to build them.

The website consists of 7 pages total, including:

* A landing page containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page.

* Four visualization pages, each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * paragraph describing the plot and its significance.


* A "Comparisons" page that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
  * The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.


* A "Data" page that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
  * The table must be a bootstrap table component.
  * The data come from exporting the .csv file as HTML, or converting it to HTML.
